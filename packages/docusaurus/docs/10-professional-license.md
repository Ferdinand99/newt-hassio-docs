# Professional License

## What is this? 

The Professional license is for Businesses and individuals that require access to licensed components within Pangolin. 

Current features that are available with the Professional license:

- OIDC IDP automatic user importing
- Stable public API with access control

Pangolin will always be free and open source but some features geared more to businesses will be covered under a different license than the AGPL in order to allow us to grow Pangolin.

## How does this work?

License keys are like upgrades to your Pangolin instance. There are two types of license keys: the HOST key and SITE keys. 

### The HOST Key

Every Pangolin instance needs a HOST key. This will unlock all of the Professional features for that instance. All of your features will be available as long as you have a HOST key. 

When purchasing the host key you can optionally choose to include a base number of sites licensed for your instance. This should be a conservative guess about how many sites you need.

To purchase a host key you will first want to navigate to our [pricing page](/pricing). 

### The Site Upgrade Keys

Once your instance is licensed you can optionally load in more sites. To do so follow the link to choose an amount of sites to upgrade to from within your Pangolin license page and complete the purchase. Load this new key into your instance an you should instantly have the limit increased.

The Professional License is billed monthly.

You can log into [Lemon Squeezy](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders/) with the same email that your purchased your keys with. From here you can deactivate an instance or manage subscriptions.

#### Can I reuse the license keys?

#### Where do I create support tickets?

Within 48 hours of your purchase you should receive an email invite to our support portal where you can interact with us.

You can then create support tickets in the [support portal](https://support.fossorial.io/).

#### What is the difference between this and the Supporter Program?

The Supporter Program is a way to support the project and remove the support marks. It is a one time donation. No features are unlocked.

The Professional plan is a paid license that allows you to use the software in a commercial environment that unlocks features and provides support. It is a monthly subscription.

#### What happens if I run out of sites? 

You will be warned if you go over your site limit before you create a site. If you do there will be a banner displayed in the Pangolin application and login pages stating you have gone over your limit but no functionality of the application will be lost.
